# Rebuild A Basic PyTorch from Scratch

### Week 1: get to know pytorch & tensor library

Pedagogical: offer a pseudo tensor library in python. 
Goal: implement a C++ CPU tensor library
Bonus: implement a CUDA tensor library

### Week 2: nn.Function & autograd.

Goal: understand computation graph, and implement autograd engine in python. support various functions
Bonus: ?

### Week 3: nn.Module (Linear, Conv2D, ReLU)

Goal: implement Module, including functionality like parameters(), named_modules(), etc. implement concrete module like Linear.
Bonus: implement some more modules

### Week 4: train a model with your own framework (SGD optimizer, simple dataloader)

Goal: implement a simple version model to train on CIFAR10, achieve 90% accuracy
